# DNA_Expression
<sub>by jb <3</sub>

Created as a homework for my biology class.

Gets DNA string as an input -> outputs it's inverse, mRNA and polypeptide counterpart.

Please don't hate me for this huge 'if' section. I hate it too...

## To run:
Clone this repository using `git clone` command

Execute `app.exe` from `/dist` folder

Enjoy this mind-blowing creation!

**If not possible to execute the file, compile it using _PyInstaller_:**

1. Go to main folder
2. In console run

`pyinstaller --onefile app.py`

1. Try running exe file again

**OR**

Just run the .py file using python

`python app.py`


Thanks!
